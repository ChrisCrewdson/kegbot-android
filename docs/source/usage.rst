Installation and Usage
======================

Installation
============

Please `download Kegbot on Google Play
<https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kegbot.app>`_.  The official
Kegtab app has the package name ``org.kegbot.app``.

.. note::
  If you do not see "Kegbot" when using Google Play on your device, it most
  likely means your device is not compatible.  See :ref:`kegtab-compatibility`.

System Setup
============

You will most likely be running Kegtab continuously, on a dedicated device.
We recommend tweaking a few global Android settings for optimum operation.

Display Sleep
-------------

Prevent the display from sleeping when power is connecting: Settings ->
Developer Options -> Keep Screen On.

Wifi Sleep
----------

Prevent Wifi from entering power saving mode when power is connected.


Usage
=====

Setup Wizard
------------

When you first start Kegtab, you'll see the Setup Wizard.

Manager PIN
-----------

During setup, you have the option to set a numeric *Manager PIN*.  If non-empty,
this PIN will be required to access certain screens within the app.

.. note::
  If you lose the manager PIN, there is *no way to recover it*.  You will need
  to uninstall Kegtab (or erase data via Settings) and re-install.
