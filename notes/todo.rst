Stuff to do::

* In KegbotApiImpl, catch protobuf unitialized errors (eg due to API change, malformed response, etc.)
* Settings: validate URL+username+password: attempt to accquire an api after any change.
* Settings: add something to select the "main" tap from available taps.
* Menu/action bar: option to switch taps if more than one available.
* Nice 9patch/drop shadow for image views
* User signup/registration (incl grab camera image)
* Implement the ControlsFragment.
* React to controller user preference and instantiate/run the appropriate controller.
* Make TapStatusFragment change when a pour is underway.
